## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Secure Local Storage**  
  All passwords are encrypted using **AES-GCM**, with keys derived from your master password using the **Argon2id** algorithm.

- **Strong Key Derivation with Argon2id**  
  Protects against brute-force and GPU-based attacks by securely deriving encryption keys from user passwords.

- **Multi-User Support**  
  Each user has a separate encrypted vault and salt file, ensuring data isolation on shared systems.

- **Password Retrieval**  
  Easily retrieve saved credentials after login, using a friendly terminal interface.

- **Cross-Platform CLI**  
  Written in Dart to run reliably on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.

- **Vault Encryption**  
  Combines modern cryptographic practices‚Äî**AES-GCM**, **Argon2id**, and secure nonces‚Äîfor safe local storage.

- **Simple Command-Line Workflow**  
  Straightforward interaction for registering users, logging in, managing passwords, and persisting encrypted data.

## üöÄ Getting Started
